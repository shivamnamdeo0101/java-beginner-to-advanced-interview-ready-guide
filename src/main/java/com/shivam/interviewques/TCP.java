TCP vs UDP:
- TCP: Connection-oriented, reliable, slower, ensures order.
- UDP: Connectionless, unreliable, faster, no guarantee of order.

Network Topologies:
- Star: All nodes connected to central hub
- Ring: Nodes connected in a circle
- Bus: Single backbone cable
- Mesh: Every node connected to every other node

    /*
Waterfall:
- Sequential phases
- Requirement -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Maintenance
- Less flexible to changes

Agile:
- Iterative and incremental
- Small sprints
- Continuous feedback and adaptation
